## Summary
I tried two times to take courses at EPAM on the Front-end.
First time just getting to know CSS. It was terrible.
The second time the epidemiological situation ruined everything.
It is my third attempt. I really like Front-end. This is very interesting! 
Solving tasks and learning new things every day is great. 
My goal is to become a Front-end and get a job at EPAM.
I want to become a professional!
